Fixtures are basically your INSERT INTO SQL statements. This is how you will seed your data base. 
They are writting in JSON and srructed as follows:
    [
        {
            "model": "<api_directory_name>.<file_name_from_models_folder>",
            "pk": <primary key>,
            "fields": {
                "key": value,
                "key": value,
                "key": value
            }
        }
    ]

Line 5 is telling what model to use
Line 6 is assigning the primary key
Line 7 is the fields sections, this will hold all the key value pairs that must match
the keys from the class that was defined in the model file.

To actually insert the data into the data base, 
run the following command in your terminal:

python3 manage.py loaddata <fixture_file_name> 

No need for the .json on the end of <fixture_file_name>

It is important to note that fixtures need to be implemted in a certain order depending on 
foreign keys. If you try to import a fixture with a foreign key tied to a table(fixture)
that hasnt been been imported yet, you'll get an error.
